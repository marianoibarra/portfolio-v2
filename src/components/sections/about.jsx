        <p>
          <strong>Fullstack developer</strong>, with experience in both web projects and mobile. I am passionate about creating
          intuitive, interactive, and visually appealing interfaces that provide an exceptional user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          For 7 years, I worked as a team leader and restaurant supervisor until 2020 when I decided to shift my focus
          towards learning and working in the programming world. There, I found the perfect fusion of my passions: <strong>
          technology,</strong> <strong>design,</strong> <strong>solution creation,</strong> and <strong>problem-solving</strong>. This transition enabled me to leverage my
          analytical skills and effectively collaborate within teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am constantly updating my knowledge and exploring new technologies to continue growing professionally. My
          goal is to keep challenging myself and contribute to exciting projects that drive technological development.
        </p>
        <p>When I'm not at the computer, you'll usually find me cycling, reading, or having fun with <HighlightHover>Balti</HighlightHover>.</p>
        <p>Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:</p>
