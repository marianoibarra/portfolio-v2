A native mobile app to check the weather of any location. It is the continuation of my previous project, which was a SPA written in React and Redux, from which I recycled a large part of the functional code, which I adapted and optimized. As for the front, all the code was rewritten from scratch to use native components, trying to make minimalism prevail getting rid of everything that could hinder the user experience.
